# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

We perform crowdfunding projects all over the world, each one with its own particularities such as country and currency based on its geographical location, a different creation, and due date, and, finally, the outcome based on original goal vs pledged money. 

To ensure new projects are successful, we want to understand how the different variables affect the final outcome. 

### Purpose

We want to understand how different crowdfunding projects campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

To execute this analysis, we have historical information for 4,115 crowdfunding projects around the world with useful information such as Money Goal, Money Pledged, Outcome, Creation Date, etc. That we have reviewed, analyze, and prepare to uncover trends and provide insights. 

We have worked out our data in two workbooks named: 

1) data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx
2) Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx

Each workbook contains the main data source at the "Kickstarter" tab and its respective analysis, the present document related to the insights found at Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
