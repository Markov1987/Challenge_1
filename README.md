To ensure new projects are successful, we want to understand how the different variables affect the final outcome. 

### Purpose

To execute this analysis, we have historical information for 4,115 crowdfunding projects around the world with useful information such as Money Goal, Money Pledged, Outcome, Creation Date, etc. That we have reviewed, analyze, and prepare to uncover trends and provide insights. 

We have worked out our data in two workbooks named: 

1) data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx
2) Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx

Each workbook contains the main data source at the "Kickstarter" tab and its respective analysis, the present document related to the insights found at Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx
